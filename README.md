## 🌀 What is Frosted Flakes?

**Why this flake collection is better than your average cereal**

Frosted Flakes is a **deliciously modular** collection of all my **Nix flake packages**. Whether you want just one or the whole cereal box, it's easy to use:

- **Each package is individually runnable**
- **All packages are exposed as overlays**
- **Install everything at once with `frosted-flakes`**

## 🏆 Why Choose Frosted Flakes?

**Convince yourself that this is the right choice**

- ✅ **Flake-powered goodness** – No impurities, just pure Nix magic.
- ✅ **Easily deployable** – No Home Manager required. Just add & go.
- ✅ **Tastes better than imperative package management.**

## 🚀 Getting Your Daily Dose of Flakes

**How to consume these flakes without milk**

### 🍽️ Running with `nix shell`

**Try before you buy—except it's free**

```sh
nix shell github:NewDawn0/frostedFlakes
```

This gives you access to all the included packages in an ephemeral environment.

### 🛠️ Installing a Single Package

**Only want one flake? We got you.**

Each package is available individually, so you can grab just what you need:

```sh
nix shell github:NewDawn0/frostedFlakes#somePackage
```

### 📦 Applying as an Overlay

**Because managing packages declaratively is just ✨better✨**

Want to add all these flakes to your system like a good Nix enjoyer? Just apply the overlay:

```nix
{
    # Add the input to your flake
    inputs.frosted-flakes.url = "github:NewDawn0/frostedFlakes";
    # Then set the overlays
    nixpkgs.overlays = [ inputs.frosted-flakes.overlays.default ];
}
```

Now you can install anything from the collection using `nix-env` or `nix shell` as usual.
